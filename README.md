# PyPass Manager 1.0

**PyPass Manager** is a GUI program that allows every user to store there passwords in one place.

All the passwords are encoded with an key that's needed to decode them again. **Key should be stored on dedicated USB for additional security**. It's a simple way of storing passwords in one place and protecting them from accessing by unauthorized users.

**Notice** - Do not store sensitive information like bank account passwords, PayPal passwords or any financial accounts. This is only a basic protection, if something was hidden and ciphered by a human it means that it can be found and deciphered by human too. If Pentagon is not safe, neither are you. \
**The safest vault for your password is your memory. If that fails use notebook.**
